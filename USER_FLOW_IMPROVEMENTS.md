# Lofi Studio - User Flow Improvements

## Current Issues

1. **Confusing Navigation**: 4 tabs shown but only 1 works (Music)
2. **No Clear Workflow**: Users don't understand the progression
3. **Dead Links**: Artwork, Compile, and Publish lead to 404 errors
4. **Missing Context**: No explanation of what each section does
5. **No Progress Tracking**: Can't see what's been completed

## Proposed User Flow

### Linear Workflow Design (Recommended)

Transform the current flat navigation into a guided step-by-step process:

```

│  [1] Create     [2] Design     [3] Compile    [4] Publish  │
│   ✓ Music       → Artwork      → Video        → Export     │
│   ● Active        ○ Next         ○ Locked       ○ Locked    │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
