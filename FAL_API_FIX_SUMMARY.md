# Fal.ai Kling Video Generation API Fix Summary

## Issue
The Fal.ai Kling video generation was not working due to incorrect endpoint URLs and potentially missing parameters.

## Root Cause
1. The endpoints were using `https://queue.fal.run/` instead of `https://fal.run/`
2. Missing `negative_prompt` parameter for Kling 2.x models
3. The endpoints were forcing queue mode which might not be necessary for all requests

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated All Fal.ai Endpoints
Changed from `https://queue.fal.run/` to `https://fal.run/` for all models:
- Kling 2.1 (standard/pro/master)
- Kling 2.0 (standard/pro/master)
- Kling 1.6 (standard/pro)
- Kling 1.5 (pro)
- Kling 1.0 (pro)
- Stable Video Diffusion
- AnimateDiff models
- Flux image generation models

### 2. Added Missing Parameters
- Added `negative_prompt` parameter for Kling 2.x models (default: "blur, distort, and low quality")
- Kept all other parameters intact

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error parsing to extract meaningful error messages from API responses
- Added comprehensive logging of raw responses for debugging
- Enhanced video URL extraction to handle multiple response formats

### 4. Response Format Handling
The API can return two types of responses:

**Direct Response (for quick operations):**
```json
{
  "video": {
    "url": "https://v3.fal.media/files/...",
    "content_type": "video/mp4",
    "file_name": "output.mp4",
    "file_size": 5102340
  }
}
```

**Queue Response (for longer operations):**
```json
{
  "request_id": "abc123",
  "status_url": "https://fal.run/status/abc123"
}
```

The code already handled both cases correctly.

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the API:
- `test-fal-kling.js` - Basic endpoint testing
- `test-kling-1.6.js` - Specific test for Kling 1.6
- `test-kling-curl.sh` - Simple curl test
- `test-fal-api-comprehensive.js` - Comprehensive API testing

## Verification
Tested Kling 1.6 API with curl and confirmed:
- The endpoint works correctly
- Returns video directly (not queued) for standard mode
- Video URL is properly formatted and accessible

## Deployment
Successfully deployed the updated worker to Cloudflare Workers.

## Available Models
The following video generation models are now properly configured:
- `kling-2.1` - Latest Kling model with standard/pro/master modes
- `kling-2.0` - Previous Kling version
- `kling-1.6` - Stable Kling version (mentioned by user)
- `kling-1.5` - Older Kling version
- `kling-1.0` - Original Kling version
- `stable-video` - Stable Video Diffusion
- `animatediff-sparsectrl` - AnimateDiff Sparse Control
- `animatediff-lightning` - AnimateDiff Lightning

## Next Steps
The Fal.ai integration should now work correctly. Users can:
1. Generate artwork using Flux models
2. Generate videos using any of the Kling models
3. The system will handle both direct and queued responses appropriately
