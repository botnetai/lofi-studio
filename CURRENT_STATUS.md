# Current Status - Lofi Music Generation Project

## Summary
The lofi music generation project is set up with multiple approaches attempted:
- **Suno**: Service suspended (503 error)
- **Udio (via musikai)**: Authentication token format incompatibility
- **UdioAPI.pro**: API key provided but returns 403 Forbidden

## What's Working
✅ Musikai tool built and configured
✅ Database initialized with authentication tokens
✅ 10 different lofi music prompts configured for each service
✅ 2captcha API key configured for automated solving
✅ Audio processing tools installed (ffmpeg, aubio)
✅ ngrok TCP tunnel support (payment method added)

## Current Blockers

### 1. Suno Service Down
```
Error: 503 Service Suspended
This service has been suspended by its owner.
```

### 2. Udio Authentication Issues
- Original cookie-based auth has format incompatibility with musikai
- Error: "couldn't unmarshal auth token ... invalid character 'k' looking for beginning of value"
- Cookie data is being read but the token format has changed since musikai was last updated

### 3. UdioAPI.pro Access
- API key: 51bdc9d9-ba8f-45fa-a34c-d7d8aadc9a6a
- Returns 403 Forbidden when attempting to generate music
- May need account activation or additional setup

## Solutions & Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Udio Authentication
The musikai tool expects the auth token in a specific JSON format, but Udio's cookie format has changed. Would need to:
1. Update musikai's auth parsing logic
2. Or manually construct the expected JSON format from the cookie data

### Option 2: Activate UdioAPI.pro
1. Check if the API key needs activation at https://udioapi.pro/dashboard
2. Verify account status and credits
3. Contact their support if needed

### Option 3: Manual Generation
1. Visit udio.com directly
2. Use the prompts from `configs/udio-lofi-prompts.csv`
3. Download tracks manually

### Option 4: Alternative Services
- **Stable Audio**: https://stableaudio.com
- **MusicGen**: Facebook's open-source model
- **Riffusion**: https://riffusion.com
- **Mubert**: https://mubert.com

## Scripts Created

### 1. UdioAPI Script
`udio-api-generate.py` - Ready to use once API access is resolved

### 2. Lofi Prompts
Both `configs/suno-lofi-prompts.csv` and `configs/udio-lofi-prompts.csv` contain 10 carefully crafted lofi music prompts

## Commands When Services Are Working

### Generate Music
```bash
# Suno (when back online)
cd musikai
./musikai generate --config ../configs/generate-lofi.yaml

# Udio (if auth is fixed)
./musikai generate --config ../configs/generate-lofi-udio.yaml

# UdioAPI (when activated)
python3 udio-api-generate.py
```

### Process & Publish
```bash
# Process audio files
./musikai process --config ../configs/process.yaml

# Web interface for track selection
./musikai web --config ../configs/web.yaml

# Generate album artwork
./musikai image --config ../configs/image.yaml

# Publish to platforms
./musikai publish --config ../configs/publish.yaml
```
