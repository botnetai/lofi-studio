# YouTube Monetization: Stream vs Upload (Money Focus)

## Regular Video Upload ðŸ’°

### Revenue Streams:
1. **AdSense Revenue**
   - Pre-roll ads: ~$1-3 CPM
   - Mid-roll ads (every 8 mins): ~$3-7 CPM
   - Display ads: ~$0.50-1 CPM
   - **Total potential**: $5-15 per 1,000 views

2. **YouTube Premium**
   - ~$0.01-0.02 per view from Premium subscribers
   - Higher retention = more revenue

3. **Channel Memberships**
   - $4.99/month tier (you keep ~70%)
   - Harder to convert on single videos

### Pros:
- **Predictable income** - Clear $/view metrics
- **Multiple videos = multiple revenue streams**
- **Evergreen content** - Keeps earning years later
- **Better CPM rates** - Advertisers prefer video content

### Cons:
- **One-time discovery** - Algorithm shows it once
- **View decay** - Most views in first 48 hours
- **Competition** - Thousands of lofi mixes uploaded daily

### Realistic Earnings Example:
- 100K views = $500-1,500
- 1M views = $5,000-15,000
- Typical lofi mix: 50K-200K views first month

## 24/7 Live Stream ðŸ”´

### Revenue Streams:
1. **Super Chat/Super Stickers**
   - Direct viewer donations during stream
   - You keep 70% (after $100 threshold)
   - **Potential**: $50-500/day for popular streams

2. **Lower Ad Revenue**
   - Fewer ad slots in streams
   - ~$0.50-2 CPM (much lower than videos)
   - Pre-roll ads only, no mid-rolls

3. **Channel Memberships**
   - MUCH higher conversion (10-20x)
   - Community feel drives subscriptions
   - Custom emotes/perks for members

### Pros:
- **Constant Super Chat income** - 24/7 donation potential
- **Higher engagement** = Higher member conversion
- **Brand sponsorships** - "Stream sponsored by..."
- **Massive concurrent viewers** - 1K-10K constantly

### Cons:
- **Server costs** - $200-500/month for reliable streaming
- **No passive income** - Stops earning when stream stops
- **Lower ad rates** - YouTube prioritizes VOD for ads
- **Requires moderation** - Hiring mods = costs

### Realistic Earnings Example:
- 1K concurrent viewers:
  - Super Chats: $100-300/day
  - Ads: $50-100/day
  - Members: 50-200 Ã— $3.50 = $175-700/month
- **Monthly total**: $4,500-12,000 (minus costs)
