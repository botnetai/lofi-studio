# YouTube Publishing Strategy: Stream vs Upload

## Option 1: Regular Video Upload
**What it is**: Upload the 60-minute compilation as a standard YouTube video

### Pros:
- **Simpler setup** - Just upload and publish
- **Full analytics** - Complete view duration, retention graphs
- **Easier monetization** - Standard AdSense, mid-roll ads
- **Download option** - Users can save offline (YouTube Premium)
- **Playlists** - Can be added to user playlists easily
- **SEO benefits** - Better search ranking for "lofi mix" searches
- **Comments section** - Community engagement
- **End screens/cards** - Promote other content

### Cons:
- **Competition** - Competing with thousands of similar videos
- **One-time discovery** - Shows up once in recommendations
- **View count pressure** - Low views look bad
- **Length penalty** - YouTube may not promote 60-min videos as much

## Option 2: YouTube Live Stream (24/7)
**What it is**: Stream the compilation on loop continuously

### Pros:
- **"Radio" appeal** - Users love 24/7 lofi streams
- **Constant presence** - Always in "Live Now" section
- **Community feel** - Live chat creates community
- **Higher engagement** - People stay longer
- **Notification power** - "Going live" notifications
- **Less competition** - Fewer 24/7 streams than videos
- **Brand building** - Becomes a destination, not just content

### Cons:
- **Technical complexity** - Need streaming setup/costs
- **Server costs** - 24/7 streaming requires infrastructure
- **No video analytics** - Limited data on what works
- **Moderation needed** - Live chat requires monitoring
- **Can't edit** - Mistakes stay live
- **Single content** - Same 60 minutes forever
